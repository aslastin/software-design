# HW2: Hashtag Frequency Calculator

## Objective

Get hands-on experience implementing unit tests and tests using mock objects.

## Description

The task is to implement component that will calculate the frequency of tweets with a certain hashtag 
over the past few hours. It's one your choice which API of social net to use 
(as for me, I'm going to use [vk api](https://vk.com/dev/manuals)).

At the input, the component must accept:
- hashtag, which will be used for searching
- `N` - the number of hours for which you need to build a tweet chart (1 <= `N` <= 24)

## Instructions

- In this task it's recommended to use SOLID-principles
- The code has to be covered with tests including mock-tests and tests with StubServer.
