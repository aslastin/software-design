# HW7: AOP Profiler

## Objective

Get hands-on experience using aspects and AOP.

## Description

Write a profiler for your application. The profiler should be implemented in an aspect-oriented paradigm. 
The profiler should allow you to:
- select the package whose classes you want to profile
- count how many times each method has been called
- calculate the average and total execution time of the method
- the advantage will be convenient visualization of profiling results (for example, in a tree structure)

## Instructions

- For java, you can use spring aop or AspectJ
- You can use other AOP frameworks (including for other languages)
- Examples from the lecture can be viewed [here](https://github.com/akirakozov/software-design/tree/master/java/aop).

## Versions

- Easy: Spring AOP
- Hard: using AspectJ/collecting into a tree structure/other AOP features
