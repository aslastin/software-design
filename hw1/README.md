# HW1: LRUCache

## Objective

To gain practical experience of using dynamic checks (assertions) in the code.

## Description

It is necessary to implement LruCache data structures on a hashmap and a doubly linked list.

When implementing, it is necessary to independently think through possible checks of pre/post conditions and class invariants.

The invented checks must be added to the implementation code in the form of assertions.

The class must be covered with tests.

## Instructions

- You cannot use LinkedHashMap directly
